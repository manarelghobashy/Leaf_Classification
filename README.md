# Leaf_Classification
## Deep Learning

## Problem formulation
- There are estimated to be nearly half a million species of plants in the 
world. Classification of species has been historically problematic and 
often results in duplicate identifications.
- This problem aims to identify 99 species of plants due to their volume, 
prevalence, and unique characteristics, which are an effective means of 
differentiating plant species.

## steps:
- Reading, exploring, and preprocessing data.
- Label encoding, normalize, and split the data into train and test.
- build the evaluation_model function.
- train the model with different hyperparameters.
